# interpreter
Silly little interpreter language I'm working on made in C++

```say``` is the print function, don't leave it blank

```is``` declares variables, use it like ```=```

Use the ```decode``` binary for the actual interpretation, it's compiled with gcc but it only uses standard libraries 
so it should work with most systems
